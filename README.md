# Overview

This is my simple Classroom managemnet program. I am using this to teach myself Java. The basics of the program are adding students to a classroom. It is a way for a teacher to keep track of students in the class. It also defines classroom size so it knows not to add more students than the class can take.

# Development Environment

I used Replit for my coding environment, I am working on converting the program over to intelij. 

I used the Java language and imported util.Scanner and util.ArrayList.
